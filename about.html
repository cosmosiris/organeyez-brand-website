  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <div id="about">
    <p>The OrganEyez team aims to produce tools and platforms that help social justice movements improve efficiency, sustainability, and effectiveness. To do this we are building 3 pillars that uphold our mission statement.</p>

    <h2>Three Pillars</h2>
    <p>The first pillar is our free software applications. We will build and release new apps according to our funding and capacity. Our first app is called Your Activist Resource Directory (YARD) and its an activist platform for creating and sharing personal libraries. YARD aims to help activists share the work of finding and collecting research papers, public policy reports, documentaries, news articles, and other crucial educational information. By organizing it all in one central location that is easy to access, we reduce repetitive work and make it easier for each organization to educate its members.</p>
    <p>The second pillar is our online community. This is a community of activists who are working to improve efficiency, sustainability, and effectiveness in grassroots movements. Through posts and discussions this community will support members as they work to find ideas and resources that can help their organizations improve internal processes, accountability, organization, recruiting, member development, campaign planning, security, and more.</p>
    <p>Third is our podcast which features inspiring stories of activists, community organizers, and researchers who will share strategies for increasing efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability within social justice movements. We strive to help thousands of activists learn strategies for security, accountability, organizational growth, project management, and more.</p>

    <h2>Internal Structure</h2>
    <p>Starting off with a strong structure helps to lay a foundation that Organ Eyez can use to become efficient and sustainable. Structure is important because structure impacts both internal culture and the community that we serve.</p>
    <p>We currently consist of four teams:</p> 
    <ul>
     <li>Technical</li>
     <li>Operations</li>
     <li>Social Media and Marketing</li>
     <li>Community and Partnerships</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As Organ Eyez’s organizational structure develops over time, we are prioritizing two strategic goals. First, it is important to build a structure and culture that preserves the mental health and capacity of Organ Eyez workers. Thus, all roles will be specialized and no worker will be allowed to take on responsibilities beyond a healthy capacity. We will not prioritize growth of our user base over the mental and physical health of our workers. And we will be sure to recognize those who willingly make significant time investments. Second, the Organ Eyez structure must have built in mechanisms for gathering feedback and updating the organizational structure. Whilst the way in which feedback is gathered, shared, and used will change over time, feedback will always be crucial to Organ Eyez’s structural and cultural evolution.</p>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>In working to become a useful resource for agents of social change we want to be run by passionate, reliable, and honest people of varying backgrounds and skill sets. Thus, we are implementing systems and procedures that hold honesty, transparency, dedication, democracy, and boundaries as our core values. We believe in slow and meaningful growth that allows us to nourish our well being and does not burn us out. This means that we will only create new initiatives, campaigns, and applications based on a realistic assessment of our capacity. Learn more about our values <a href="file:///Users/irismac2016/MyApps/organeyez/organeyez-brand-website/images/values-description.jpg" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
   
    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>Our financial status is that of an LLC owned by the founder, Iris Nevins. This allows us to avoid the bureaucracy and red tape of running a non-profit. We ask supporters to help pay for organizational costs and labor by sending monthly donations to our Patreon account. This is our only form of income for the work that we do and we determine compensation based on sweat equity. What does this mean? We use our funds to first pay for expenses such as website, podcast, communication, and marketing services. If there is a shortage of funding, we help to cover costs ourselves. If there is a surplus of funding then we divide up the surplus amount based on a sweat equity formula that we created. This formula determines what percentage of the surplus we receive based on the hours of work we have completed and the length of time we have been contributing to the organization. Compensation is never guaranteed, so none of us are here for the money. Whether we earn $10 or $500, the mission is why we are here and all compensation is just a meaningful way to thank us for the work we do.
