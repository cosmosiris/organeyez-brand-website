      <p class="name">Iris</p>
      <p class="title">Founder & Director</p>
      <p>While volunteering as a community organizer I realized that tools such as software could be used to automate, speed up, and/or streamline many of the tasks that help to keep organizations alive and effective.</p> 
      <p>This realization led me to leave my career as a teacher and become a software engineer with the goal of contributing my ever-growing technical knowledge and skills to grassroots movements. OrganEyez is the culmination of years of chasing my passions and finding my purpose.</p>

      <p class="name">Shane</p>
      <p class="title">Podcast Producer & Software Engineer</p>
      <p>Shane is joining OrganEyez because they firmly believe in the role of technology in the social revolution. When not falling deeper and deeper into The Cult of Ruby, Shane spends most of their free time reading comic books, thinking about the Dragon Age video game series, and eating a balanced diet of green smoothies and burritos. Their favorite season is Fall and they’re afraid of whales.</p>
