      <p class="name">Iris</p>
      <p class="title">Founder & Director</p>
      <p>While volunteering as a community organizer I realized that software make us a lot more effective. This realization led me to leave my career as a teacher and become a software engineer with the goal of contributing my ever-growing technical knowledge and skills to grassroots movements. I work full-time at Mailchimp and Organeyez, my passion project, is the culmination of years of chasing my passions and finding my purpose.</p>

      <p class="name">Bertisha</p>
      <p class="title">Podcast Manager</p>
      <p>Bertisha is a South Florida community organizer who believes that activists truly need to have their own space where they can share their ideas, knowledge and experiences in order to enhance the fight in social justice movements. She believes that in order for us all to be free, we need to start by understanding each other and coming up with concrete solutions in this fight for our lives.</p>

      <p class="title">Podcast Producer & Software Engineer</p>
      <p>Shane firmly believes in the role of technology in the social revolution. When not falling deeper and deeper into The Cult of Ruby, Shane spends most of their free time reading comic books, thinking about the Dragon Age video game series, and eating a balanced diet of green smoothies and burritos. Their favorite season is Fall and they&#8217re afraid of whales.</p>

      <p class="name">Kelly</p>
      <p class="title">Software Engineer</p>
      <p>Kelly strives to put tech to use in service of people and movements, as opposed to capital. When not writing code, she spends time exploring worlds, whether through writing fiction, playing immersive, time suck video games, reading, traveling or painting. She also loves to cook for friends and family and get horrifyingly lost in the wilderness. She&#8217s recently re-taken up jogging for the thousandth time in her life, but still hates it.</p>

In her freetime, you can catch her dancing to Latin music such as Bachata and Reggaeton, watching comedy shows, baking, and trying a fitness class outdoors. </p>
